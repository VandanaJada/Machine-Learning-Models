# Supervised Learning Models

## Overview
This section of the repository is dedicated to Supervised Learning models. Supervised Learning is a core area of machine learning where the algorithm learns from labeled training data, helping predict outcomes for unforeseen data. Here, you'll find a variety of models that demonstrate different supervised learning techniques.

## Models Included
- **Linear Regression**: Predicting continuous outcomes based on one or more predictors. Ideal for establishing linear relationships between variables.
- **Ridge Regression**: A type of linear regression that includes a regularization term. Helps prevent overfitting by penalizing large coefficients.
- **Lasso Regression**: Similar to ridge regression but uses a different regularization technique that can completely eliminate the influence of some features. Useful for feature selection.
- **Logistic Regression**: Used for binary classification problems. It estimates the probability of a binary response based on one or more predictor variables.
- **Decision Trees**: Non-linear models that divide the dataset into subsets based on different criteria. Simple to understand and interpret, and useful for classification and regression tasks.
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble of decision trees, typically used for classification and regression. It improves the predictive accuracy and controls overfitting by averaging the results of individual trees.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVMs)**: Effective in high-dimensional spaces, used for both regression and classification. SVMs are particularly useful for datasets where classes are not linearly separable.
- **K Nearest Neighbors (KNNs)**: A simple, instance-based learning algorithm used for classification and regression. It classifies data points based on the majority vote or average of its K nearest neighbors.
- **Naive Bayes Classifier**: Based on Bayes' theorem, it assumes independence among predictors. Itâ€™s particularly suited for high-dimensional datasets and often used for text classification.
- **XGBoost Classifier**: An efficient and scalable implementation of gradient boosting. It is known for its speed and performance and is widely used in winning solutions of data science competitions.

## Getting Started
To get started with these models, navigate to the desired model's directory. Each model directory contains:
- A detailed README explaining the model, its applications, and its implementation.
- Jupyter notebooks with step-by-step implementation (`model_name.ipynb`).
- A `data` folder containing the dataset(s) used in the model.
- A `requirements.txt` file listing all the necessary Python packages.

## Prerequisites
Before running the models, ensure you have the following:
- Python 3.x installed.
- Basic understanding of machine learning concepts and algorithms.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the specific model directory.
3. Install the required packages using: pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Open the Jupyter notebook and run the cells to see the model in action.
