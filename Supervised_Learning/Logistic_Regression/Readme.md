# Logistic Regression

## Overview

Logistic Regression is a statistical method used for binary classification. Unlike linear regression which predicts continuous values, logistic regression is used when the output variable is categorical. It predicts the probability of an instance belonging to a particular class.

## Applications

Logistic Regression is widely used in various fields such as:

- **Medical Diagnoses**: Predicting whether a patient has a certain disease or not.
- **Marketing**: Predicting whether a customer will purchase a product.
- **Credit Scoring**: Determining if a loan applicant is a credit risk.
- **Spam Detection**: Classifying emails as spam or not spam.
